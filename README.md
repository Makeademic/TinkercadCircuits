# TinkercadCircuits
This is my project statement. What I want to talk about is my input: and my output: and why I combined them. Is this functional? Is this creative? This is how I envision people replicating my project. I envision this project to also include these peripherals: maybe a 3D printed container, or a cardboard gear, or something else.
